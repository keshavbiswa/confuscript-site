Welcome to **Confuscript**! This is not just another programming language; it's an exercise in cognitive somersaults, a dive into a world where traditional programming rules are turned upside-down. Built entirely on Ruby, This is a fun programming language to confuse yourself.`

## Why Confuscript?

The name `Confuscript` means `Confusing JavaScript`. Inspired by the syntax of `JavaScript`, 

Confuscript is a fun programming language that will make you think twice about everything you know about programming.

While most Programming languages have become easier to learn, I wanted to make it difficult and confusing.

Confuscript is not designed for production applications (But who am I to stop you?), but rather as a fun way to challenge your brain, learn new ways of thinking, and perhaps even gain a deeper understanding of the languages you use every day by seeing them in a new light.

## Features

Here are some of the bewildering features that make Confuscript stand out:

- **console.input**: The opposite of `console.log`, here `input` means `output`
- **Null**: `Null` is not `null`, it's how you declare a variable.
- **Else if**: `If-else` conditions runs opposite to one another (if condition is true, run else)
- **Inverse Operators**: Yes, + is now -, and vice-versa.
